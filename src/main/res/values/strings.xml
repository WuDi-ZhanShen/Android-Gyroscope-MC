    <string name="help_text">This APP can create a virtual GamePad and convert real-time gyroscope data to the GamePad\'s right stick within 0.05ms。\n\nIn simple terms, you can use the gyroscope to play games that support GamePad, such as Minecraft. These games will mistakenly recognize that there is a GamePad controlling the movement of the perspective, while the phone\'s gyroscope is the real controller.\n\nHere are some issues and answers when using this app to play Minecraft:\n\n1.The gyroscope sensitivity is different when walking and stopping?\nAnswer: Please find the "Controller" section in Minecraft settings, adjust the \"Sensitivity\" to about 25.\n\n2.Cannot open windows such as backpack, workbench, chat box, villager trading, etc.?\nAnswer: Click on the floating ball to temporarily pause the gyroscope.\n\n3.After turning off the gyroscope, the game perspective is always biased towards a certain direction?\nAnswer: First click on the floating ball to pause the gyroscope, and then turn off the gyroscope.\n\n4.Is there a high delay in gyroscope operation?\nAnswer: If your phone does not have a high refresh rate, both touch and gyroscope operations will have a longer delay. You can swipe left and right quickly with your fingers to determine whether there is a delay in touch operations, and determine whether the delay comes from the device itself or from my program. If you confirm that there is no delay in touch operations but there is a delay in gyroscope operations, you can provide feedback to me.\n\n5.Will using the gyroscope in online PVP games trigger an anti-cheating detection?\nAnswer: Only external devices can be detected.\n</string>
